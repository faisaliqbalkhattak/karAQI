# karAQI — Karak Air Quality Index Predictor

A **72-hour US EPA AQI forecast** for Karak, Pakistan, built as an end-to-end machine learning pipeline with automated CI/CD, a feature store, model registry, and a live Streamlit dashboard. The system fetches hourly pollutant and weather data from Open-Meteo (free, keyless), trains multiple ML models daily, and serves pre-computed predictions to every dashboard visitor with near-instant page load.

> **Data disclaimer:** Karak has no local ground-air-quality monitor. All features and the AQI target are derived from Open-Meteo CAMS modeled/reanalysis data, not station measurements. Results describe model-to-model agreement, not ground-truth station accuracy.

## Live Dashboard

**[kaqindex.streamlit.app](https://kaqindex.streamlit.app/)**

---

## Architecture

The system uses a **static JSON serving architecture** — predictions are pre-computed by CI pipelines and stored in a separate data repository. The dashboard fetches these JSON files via raw GitHub URLs, giving every visitor a near-instant page load with zero runtime inference.

```
karAQI (code repo)                      karAQI-data (data repo)

### CI/CD Pipeline Schedule

All pipelines run on GitHub Actions. See [docs/cicd-pipelines.md](docs/cicd-pipelines.md) for the full architecture and troubleshooting history.

| Workflow | Schedule (UTC) | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature_pipeline.yml` | Hourly at `:01` | Incremental data fetch (~1 row), build features, run tests | Feature store (DuckDB) |
| `forecast_pipeline.yml` | Hourly at `:04` | Run best model inference, fetch Open-Meteo AQ forecast (with retry), export JSON | `static_forecast.json` → karAQI-data |
| `training_pipeline.yml` | Daily at `00:00` | Incremental fetch, train Ridge + XGBoost, champion comparison, register in MLflow, export eval JSON | `model_eval.json` + model files → karAQI-data |

> **Incremental fetching:** The feature pipeline runs hourly and fetches only the new data since the last pull (typically ~1 row). Open-Meteo reanalysis data is immutable — historical values never change — so incremental fetching is safe and avoids re-downloading 4 years of data on every run. See [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md).

> **Champion comparison:** The training pipeline compares new model metrics against the current champion in MLflow. Only promotes if the new model is better on hourly_points RMSE. If worse, the old champion is kept and the comparison is logged. No silent fallbacks — the pipeline fails loudly if the registry is empty.

> **GitHub Actions timing caveat:** Cron triggers are best-effort, not precise. Workflows are frequently delayed 5–30 minutes (sometimes longer) due to platform load — see [github/community#156282](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/156282). If the dashboard shows a previous hour's AQI, the CI pipeline was delayed. The data is still correct — it reflects the most recent successful run. See [docs/cicd-pipelines.md](docs/cicd-pipelines.md).

## Model Performance (Live Dashboard Metrics)

The training pipeline trains **2 models** for the hourly 30-output forecast: Ridge and XGBoost. LSTM and Random Forest were evaluated during development but removed from CI: LSTM took 1+ hour to train on CPU (GitHub Actions) and had the worst RMSE (24.21); Random Forest produced a 4.25 GB model file that exceeds GitHub's 100 MB file size limit. The champion is selected by lowest RMSE on the primary output group (hourly points).

30 outputs per forecast origin: 24 hourly points (`t+1h` through `t+24h`), four six-hour block means (`t+25h` through `t+48h`), and two twelve-hour block means (`t+49h` through `t+72h`).

The forecast payload also includes an **Open-Meteo AQ reference forecast** (72h of hourly US AQI from `air-quality-api.open-meteo.com`) for transparent comparison on the dashboard. The fetch uses 3 retries with escalating timeouts (15s/30s/45s) because the Open-Meteo air-quality endpoint is occasionally slow under GitHub Actions shared infrastructure.

### Hourly Models — Rolling-Origin Evaluation

Protocol: 3 expanding folds, 168-hour test windows, 72-hour embargo.

| Output Group | RMSE | MAE | R² | Category Accuracy | High-AQI Recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Hourly points (1–24h)** | **11.16** | **8.59** | **0.326** | **90.0%** | **69.3%** |
| **Six-hour means (25–48h)** | **18.52** | **13.95** | -0.026 | **77.7%** | **55.3%** |
| **Twelve-hour means (49–72h)** | **19.11** | **15.33** | -0.110 | **66.8%** | **48.4%** |
| Persistence baseline (1–24h) | 12.57 | 9.73 | 0.142 | 87.2% | 62.8% |
| Persistence baseline (25–48h) | 22.95 | 17.91 | -0.556 | 69.7% | 56.0% |
| Persistence baseline (49–72h) | 27.50 | 22.95 | -1.269 | 56.3% | 51.6% |

**The selected model beats both persistence and seasonal persistence on RMSE and MAE for all three output groups.** This is the release gate. The champion comparison ensures only models that improve on the current best are promoted — see [docs/cicd-pipelines.md](docs/cicd-pipelines.md).

### Daily Model Comparison (chronological holdout, +1/+2/+3 days)

| Model | +1 Day RMSE | +1 Day R² | +2 Day RMSE | +2 Day R² | +3 Day RMSE | +3 Day R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| XGBoost | 15.78 | 0.513 | 19.40 | 0.263 | 20.72 | 0.168 |
| Random Forest | 16.28 | 0.482 | 19.48 | 0.257 | 20.71 | 0.169 |
| Ridge | 16.66 | 0.457 | 19.98 | 0.219 | 20.66 | 0.173 |
| SARIMA | 26.40 | -0.363 | 23.79 | -0.108 | 22.74 | -0.002 |
| LSTM | 24.86 | -0.208 | 26.99 | -0.426 | 25.08 | -0.219 |
| Persistence | 18.55 | 0.326 | 22.95 | -0.018 | 25.38 | -0.259 |

**Best daily model by horizon:** XGBoost for +1/+2 days, Ridge for +3 days.

### Interpretation Guide

- **RMSE** — Root mean squared error in AQI units. Lower is better. An RMSE of 11 means the typical prediction error is ±11 AQI points.
- **R²** — Proportion of variance explained relative to the mean-prediction baseline. R² = 0 means "no better than guessing the average." Negative R² means the model is worse than the average.
- **Category accuracy** — Percentage of predictions in the correct EPA AQI band (Good/Moderate/Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups/Unhealthy/Very Unhealthy/Hazardous).
- **High-AQI recall** — Percentage of truly polluted hours the model correctly flags. Important for health alerts.

## Data Sources

| Source | Purpose | API Key | Rate Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open-Meteo Air Quality API | Primary pollutant data + AQI forecast reference | None | Fair use |
| Open-Meteo Weather Archive API | Weather features (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) | None | Fair use |
| Open-Meteo Forecast API | Live weather verification | None | Fair use |

All timestamps normalized to `Asia/Karachi` (UTC+5). Historical data spans 2000–present for weather trends, 2022-08-05–present for AQI training.

**Resilience:** The Open-Meteo air-quality forecast endpoint (`air-quality-api.open-meteo.com`) is occasionally slow under GitHub Actions shared infrastructure. The forecast pipeline retries up to 3 times with escalating timeouts (15s → 30s → 45s) and exponential backoff (2s, 4s) before giving up. If all attempts fail, the forecast is exported without the Open-Meteo comparison line (the dashboard shows `ref_forecast: []`). See [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md) for the full contract.

## AQI Target Definition

`src/aqi.py` calculates US EPA AQI using the official breakpoint method, including the May 2024 PM₂.₅ breakpoint update. The target is:

- **Daily:** `aqi_us_epa` — complete calendar-day 24-hour PM averages, maximum valid 8-hour ozone/CO windows, maximum valid 1-hour SO₂/NO₂ windows, EPA unit conversions/truncation, breakpoint interpolation, and category assignment.
- **Hourly:** `aqi_hourly_rolling` — a rolling-hour estimate from EPA pollutant sub-indices; not the official once-per-day AQI report.

Both are derived from Open-Meteo modeled concentrations, not ground-station measurements.

## Feature Store and Model Registry

| Component | Implementation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Feature store | DuckDB (`data/feature_store/karak_feature_store.duckdb`) | Serverless, no API key, free, works on Windows |
| Model registry | MLflow file-backed (`models/mlruns/`) | No tracking server needed, satisfies serverless requirement |

### What a Model Registry Is

A model registry manages the full ML model lifecycle: version control, staging (dev → staging → production), metadata tracking (metrics, parameters, data lineage), and access control. Industry examples include MLflow Model Registry (server-backed), Vertex AI Model Registry, and Hopsworks.

### What We Use

Our MLflow instance is **file-backed** — it stores model versions and metadata in local `mlruns/` directories, not on a persistent server. The trained model binary (`.joblib`) is also pushed to the `karAQI-data` GitHub repo so the forecast pipeline can download it. This functions as a lightweight model registry: it tracks which model version is the champion, logs metrics, and supports version-based loading. For a production system, a server-backed registry (e.g., MLflow Tracking Server on Databricks, Vertex AI) would provide stronger guarantees around access control, audit trails, and model serving integration. For this project's scale and the assignment's serverless requirement, the file-backed approach is sufficient.

### Why Model Files Are Also in GitHub

The `karAQI-data` repo stores the actual model binaries (`.joblib` files) because the forecast pipeline on GitHub Actions needs to download them before running inference. MLflow's file-backed store only exists within the CI runner (ephemeral), so the model files must be persisted somewhere the forecast pipeline can access them. GitHub repo storage serves as the durable artifact store.

The feature store is used by the **training and forecast pipelines** (not the dashboard). The forecast pipeline reads features from DuckDB (`--source store`). The model registry is used by the **forecast pipeline** to load the champion model for inference. The dashboard reads pre-computed JSON for speed.

Registered models: `aqi-hourly` (champion, hourly 30-output), `aqi-daily-h1`, `aqi-daily-h2`, `aqi-daily-h3`.
